## Implementation

The primary data structure used is a **Treap**. This is a randomized binary search tree that maintains both BST property by keys and heap property by random priorities. The code consists of the TreapNode and Treap classes which implement: Insert, Delete, Search, Split, Merge, and RangeQuery operations.

### TreapNode Class:
**Description:** Represents a node in the Treap, containing a key, random priority, and left/right child pointers.

**Constructor:** Initializes a new node with the given key and assigns a random priority value.

**Time Complexity:** O(1) for initialization.

### Methods for Treap:

**1. Insert:** This method inserts a key into the treap  
**Input:** int key  
**Operation:** Recursively inserts the key while maintaining BST and heap properties through rotations  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**2. Delete(int key):** Removes a key from the treap  
**Input:** int key  
**Operation:** Finds and removes the specified key while maintaining treap properties through rotations  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**3. Search(int key):** Searches for a key in the treap  
**Input:** int key  
**Operation:** Traverses the treap using BST property to find the key  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**4. Split(int key):** Splits the treap into two treaps  
**Input:** int key  
**Operation:** Divides the treap into left treap (keys < key) and right treap (keys â‰¥ key)  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**5. Merge(Treap, Treap):** Merges two treaps into one  
**Input:** Two treap objects  
**Operation:** Combines two treaps while maintaining heap property based on priorities  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**6. RangeQuery(int low, int high):** Finds all keys within a range  
**Input:** int low, int high  
**Operation:** Traverses the treap and prints all keys within the specified range  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n + k) where k is the number of keys in range
